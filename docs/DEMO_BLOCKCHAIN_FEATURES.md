# Demo Blockchain Features - Main Branch

## Overview

The **main branch** includes **simulated blockchain functionality** that demonstrates token rewards and compliance incentives without requiring actual blockchain infrastructure. This is perfect for presentations and development.

## Demo Blockchain Features

### 🪙 **Token Simulation**
- **CHAIN tokens** are simulated in the console and UI
- Rewards are calculated and displayed like real blockchain
- Token balances are tracked in the database as `TokenTransaction` records
- No actual on-chain transactions occur

### 🎯 **Reward System**
```typescript
// Example from demo-simulator.ts
console.log(`🪙 Awarded ${tokens} CHAIN tokens for workflow completion`);
```

**Reward Types:**
- **Workflow Completion**: 10-50 CHAIN tokens
- **Compliance Excellence**: 50-500 CHAIN tokens  
- **Cold Chain Maintenance**: 25-100 CHAIN tokens
- **Emergency Response**: 100+ CHAIN tokens

### 📊 **Demo Features**

#### 1. **Simulated Wallet**
- Organization "wallets" are database records
- Token balances are calculated from transaction history
- No private keys or real blockchain addresses

#### 2. **Compliance Scoring**
- Real compliance calculations based on:
  - Cold chain temperature compliance
  - Audit trail completeness
  - Response time metrics
  - Workflow completion rates

#### 3. **Token Transaction History**
- All "transactions" stored in PostgreSQL
- Includes transaction hash simulation
- Shows reward reasons and amounts
- Tracks organization performance

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Token transactions are stored as regular database records
model TokenTransaction {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  transactionHash String   @unique
  blockNumber     Int
  
  // Token Details
  fromAddress     String?
  toAddress       String
  amount          String
  tokenSymbol     String   @default("CHAIN")
  
  // Transaction Details
  transactionType String   // COMPLIANCE_REWARD, WORKFLOW_COMPLETION, etc.
  status          String   @default("CONFIRMED")
  reason          String?
  
  // Metadata
  organizationId  String
  workflowId      String?
  
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## How Demo Works

### 1. **Workflow Completion**
```typescript
// In workflowService.ts
async completeWorkflow(workflowId: string) {
  // ... complete workflow logic
  
  // Award simulated tokens
  const rewardAmount = calculateReward(workflow);
  await this.awardTokens(organizationId, rewardAmount, 'Workflow completion');
  
  // Show in UI and console
  console.log(`🪙 Awarded ${rewardAmount} CHAIN tokens`);
}
```

### 2. **Compliance Scoring**
```typescript
// Real compliance calculation
const complianceScore = calculateCompliance({
  coldChainScore: 95,
  auditScore: 98,
  responseTime: 92
});

// Simulated reward based on real score
if (complianceScore >= 90) {
  await awardTokens(orgId, 500, 'Platinum compliance');
}
```

### 3. **Demo UI Features**
- Token balance displays (from database)
- Transaction history (simulated)
- Reward notifications (real-time WebSocket)
- Compliance dashboards (real metrics)

## Running Demo Features

### Start Demo System
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev

# Run demo scenarios
npm run demo:scenario specimen    # Shows token rewards
npm run demo:scenario recall      # Emergency response rewards
npm run demo:scenario iot         # Compliance monitoring
```

### Demo Outputs
```
🧪 Starting Laboratory Specimen Journey Demo...
✅ Step 1: Specimen created - SPEC001234567890
📱 Step 2: IoT sensor attached - IOT_TEMP_001
🚛 Step 3: Transport simulation started
🚨 Step 4: Temperature violation triggered!
✅ Step 5: Compliance issue resolved
🪙 Awarded 50 CHAIN tokens for workflow completion
🏆 Compliance score: 95% - Platinum tier reached!
🪙 Awarded 500 CHAIN tokens for compliance excellence
```

## Demo vs. Real Blockchain

### **Demo Version (Main Branch)**
- ✅ Fast setup - no blockchain required
- ✅ Perfect for presentations
- ✅ Shows all functionality
- ✅ No gas fees or complexity
- ✅ Simulated but realistic

### **Real Blockchain (blockchain-integration branch)**
- ✅ Actual on-chain transactions
- ✅ Real CHAIN tokens on Avalanche
- ✅ MetaMask integration
- ✅ Smart contract deployment
- ❌ Complex setup required

## Switching Between Versions

### Use Demo Version When:
- Presenting to stakeholders
- Developing healthcare features
- Testing workflow automation
- Demonstrating compliance features

### Use Blockchain Version When:
- Deploying to production
- Needing real token economics
- Integrating with DeFi protocols
- Requiring on-chain verification

## Benefits of Demo Approach

1. **Quick Setup**: No blockchain infrastructure needed
2. **Reliable Demos**: No network issues or gas problems
3. **Focus on Healthcare**: Blockchain doesn't distract from core features
4. **Cost Effective**: No transaction fees for testing
5. **Consistent Results**: Predictable reward calculations

## Migrating to Real Blockchain

When ready to use real blockchain:

```bash
# Switch to blockchain integration branch
git checkout blockchain-integration

# Deploy smart contracts
cd contracts
npm run deploy:fuji

# Update environment variables
# Start with real blockchain features
```

The demo blockchain features provide all the visual and functional benefits of tokenization while keeping the system simple and reliable for demonstrations and development.
