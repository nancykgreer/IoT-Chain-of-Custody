# Healthcare Chain of Custody Application

## Project Overview
Comprehensive chain of custody system for healthcare items including:
- Laboratory specimens
- Patient samples  
- Medical devices
- Pharmaceuticals

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express/NestJS
- **Frontend**: Angular (security-first approach)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (HIPAA/GDPR compliant)
- **Blockchain**: Avalanche with healthcare subnet
- **Token**: Custom ERC-20 on Avalanche for incentives

## Compliance Requirements
- **HIPAA** (US Healthcare)
- **GDPR** (EU Data Protection)
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** (Electronic Records)
- **CLIA** (Clinical Laboratory Standards)

## Core Features
- Multi-type item tracking (polymorphic architecture)
- Immutable audit trails via blockchain
- Barcode/QR scanning for mobile use
- Role-based access control
- Temperature/condition monitoring
- Digital signatures and compliance reporting
- Token-based incentive system

## Architecture Benefits
- **Security**: Angular built-ins + PostgreSQL encryption
- **Scalability**: Avalanche subnets for high throughput
- **Compliance**: Multi-jurisdictional data residency
- **Interoperability**: EVM compatibility + healthcare standards
- **Cost-effective**: Low transaction fees vs Ethereum

## Development Phases
1. Core application setup
2. Database schema and models
3. Blockchain integration
4. Frontend implementation
5. Mobile optimization
6. Compliance testing and certification
